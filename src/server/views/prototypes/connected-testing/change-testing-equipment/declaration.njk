      <p>I understand that the equipment will be checked by DVSA at the next visit.</p>

      <p>The Vehicle Examiner will check if:</p>

      <ul class="list list-bullet">
          <li>the equipment is on the approved equipment list</li>
          <li>the equipment has been installed and calibrated correctly</li>
          <li>the layout and dimensions of the Vehicle Testing Station still meet the requirements for authorisation</li>
          <li>the connected equipment is sending results to the MOT testing service</li>
      </ul>

      <div class="govuk-warning-text">
        <span class="govuk-warning-text__icon" aria-hidden="true">!</span>
        <strong class="govuk-warning-text__text">
          If the changes you have made do not meet these requirements,  DVSA will not approve the changes and you may have to stop testing.
        </strong>
      </div>

      <p>By submitting these details to DVSA you confirm that the information you have given is true, complete and accurate.</p>
